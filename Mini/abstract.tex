% In the realm of drone control, the accuracy and contextual understanding of voice command recognition systems stand as critical determinants of their efficacy. Current systems face challenges in accuracy, particularly in complex environments, leading to frequent misinterpretations of commands. The absence of a robust contextual understanding exacerbates these issues. The work delves into an innovative approach to address these challenges, introducing a reliable assessment scheme that leverages confidence scores from DeepSpeech and Tensor Flow, coupled with contextual clues from a Natural Language Processing (NLP) stage. The aim is to enhance the accuracy and reliability of voice command recognition systems used in micro air vehicle (MAV) control.

% The assessment scheme evaluates the accuracy and validity of recognized commands, providing a decision-making framework for controlling drones. By utilizing confidence scores from DeepSpeech and contextual clues from NLP, the scheme mutually reinforces the identification of incorrect recognitions. The outcomes of the approach include improved accuracy and safety in drone control, reducing instances of misinterpretations. Moreover, the scheme addresses a pivotal gap by introducing multilingual support, thereby broadening accessibility on a global scale. The integration of the scheme with Mission Planner ground control station promises enhanced control capabilities, making it a pivotal advancement in the field of speech recognition for drone control.
