Add a sidebar section that shows latest stock news relevant to the selected ticker.

Summarize each news headline in 1–2 lines.

Add overall sentiment score (positive/neutral/negative).

Explain how this sentiment impacts the stock (price pressure, volatility, investor mood).

Show example outputs for positive news, negative news, and neutral news.

2. Trading Signals Section

Fully explain how the signals (BUY, SELL, HOLD, STRONG BUY, STRONG SELL) are generated.

Explain the meaning of each value:

Signal strength

Predicted % change

Confidence score

Explain why certain dates gave HOLD or BUY signals.

Show sample interpretations like:

“Model predicts small upward movement → HOLD.”

“Model predicts strong trend + high confidence → BUY.”

3. Risk Management Module

Explain how the risk score is calculated.

Include:

Volatility

Anomaly detection

Sudden price jumps

Volume spikes

Clarify the meaning of:

Low risk

Medium risk

High risk

4. Model Benchmarking

Compare Prophet, Naive, and Moving Average (MA) models.

Explain each accuracy metric (RMSE, MAE, MAPE, Directional Accuracy, Volatility Accuracy).

Explain why Prophet is the best model in this dashboard.

Compare how each model behaves on volatile vs stable stocks.

5. Backtesting Module
